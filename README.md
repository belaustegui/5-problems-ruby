My solutions to the ["_Five programming problems every Software Engineer should
be able to solve in less than 1 hour_"](https://blog.svpino.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour) by @svpino

## Why
I've implemented the solutions to this problems in Ruby as a learning exercise.
Apart from the required solutions I've implemented some other solutions (IMHO)
closer to the Ruby Way, this is the case of problems 1 and 2.

## The problems
All the problems are related in the [original article by @svpino](https://blog.svpino.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour).

1.  Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list
    using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.
2.  Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements.
    For example: given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function
    should return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].
3.  Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.
    By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1,
    and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example,
    here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.
4.  Write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges them
    such that they form the largest possible number. For example,
    given [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest formed number is 95021.
5.  Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing
    between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is
    always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.
